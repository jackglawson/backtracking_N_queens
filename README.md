# backtracking_N_queens
A backtracking algorithm to solve the N queens problem.

N queens must be placed on an N x N grid such that none of them can attack each other. 
My algorithm lists and counts all possible solutions and works in reasonable time up to N=9 (352 solutions).

Optimise by exploiting symmetries
